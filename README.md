### DIY Perpetual Planner


I got fed up with the quality of the planners I've been buying lately. Especially moleskin - the paper is so thin I can't use a G2 without bleed..


The idea is simple, give the script a start date and the number of days you would like and it will output a pdf file that you can print and cut.

I designed this for use with the Staples ARC mini notebooks.
